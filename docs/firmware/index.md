# Updating Anima Firmware

Tintallë can update the firmware on your Anima. Please exercise caution when performing this operation, and don't be afraid to [ask for help](../troubleshooting/gettinghelp.md) if needed.

*Screenshots coming soon.*

???- question "What is Firmware?"
    "Firmware" refers to software that is embedded on a device. In this case, it's the instructions that live in the Anima hardware that tell it how to do what it does. New firmware releases can add new features, fix bugs, or improve performance.

!!! note
    Currently, Tintallë only supports firmware updates for Anima EVO models. ***Anima NXT firmware updates are not supported at this time.*** We hope that future updates will support the Anima NXT!

## Checking for Firwmare Updates

Tintallë can check automatically to see if there is a newer firmware build than is installed on your Anima.

1. [Connect](../general/connecting.md) your Anima.
2. From the menu bar, click **Firmware :material-arrow-right-thin: Check for Latest Firmware**

If there is an update available, Tintallë will prompt you to download and install it.

## Installing Firmware from a File

If you already have the firmware file downloaded (or you have compiled custom firmware), you can manually choose the firmware to install.

1. [Connect](../general/connecting.md) your Anima.
2. From the menu bar, click **Firmware :material-arrow-right-thin: Install Firmware from File...**
3. Locate and choose the firmware .hex file.

Tintallë will run the command to install the file and display the results.
