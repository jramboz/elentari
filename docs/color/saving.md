# Saving Colors to the Anima

When you [adjust a color setting](colors.md), Tintallë will not automatically save the changes to you Anima. You must explicitly save your changes in order to write the new values to the Anima.

## Saving the Current Bank

To save only the currently selected [color bank](banks.md), click the **Save Bank to Saber** button. This will set the values for all effects in the bank you have selected.

## Saving All Color Banks

To save all the changes you have made, click the **Save All Banks to Saber** button. This will save all changes to any of the [color banks](banks.md) you have made. This is especially useful if you have [loaded color settings from a saved file](color_files.md#loading-colors-from-a-file).

## Reloading Configuration (Discarding Changes)

If you want to reload the last configuration saved to the Anima, you can either:

- Click the **Reset Changes** button, or
- From the menu bar, select **Connection :material-arrow-right-thin: Reload Config**.

!!! warning
    This will discard any changes you have made (to any color *or* sound configuration) and reset Tintallë back to the configration loaded from the Anima.
