# Elent√°ri
This is a Python-based alternative to [Gilthoniel](https://github.com/Nuntis-Spayz/gilthoniel) for managing OpenCore-based light sabers.

This is still very much a work in progress at the moment. It's not even close to feature-complete, but I'm throwing it up here in case anyone wants to start peeking.

## Current Features
- Scan ports for sabers
- Connect to saber
- Erase all files on saber
- Upload files to saber

## Status
This is not guaranteed to be bug-free. In fact, it's practically guaranteed to have bugs! I'm just an amateur coder who's doing his best to make a thing. I'm sure there's sloppy code in here, and probably a lot of things that can be done better. But I'm learning as I go, and maybe down the road someone more knowlegable can clean things up.

## Requirements
- Pyside6
- [py2saber](https://github.com/jramboz/py2saber) source - clone the Git repo or download `py2saber.py` into the `elentari` directory.
