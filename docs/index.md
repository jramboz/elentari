## What is Tintallë?

Tintallë is a software application for configuring lightsabers built on Anima cores from [Lama di Luce](https://www.lamadiluce.it/). Tintallë supports both the Anima EVO and Anima NXT models; for older Animas, see this page.

- :material-language-python: ***Cross-platform.*** Built on a core of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Qt/PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python), Tintallë runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- :material-party-popper: ***Intuitive, easy-to-use, and fun.*** Or at least, I hope it is!

!!! question "Why Tintallë?"
    The original Anima saber management software is named [Gilthoniel](https://github.com/Nuntis-Spayz/gilthoniel), which means "star-kindler" in [Sindarin](https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/sindarin.html). Since my software owes a huge debt to Gilthoniel, I named mine Tintallë, which has the same meaning in [Quenya](https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/q/quenya.html).
