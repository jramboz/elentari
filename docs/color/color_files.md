# Saving and Loading Colors to a File

Once you've found that perfect set of colors, you don't want to lose it! Or sometimes you want to apply the same custom colors to multiple Animas. For this, Tintallë allows you to save color settings to a file on your computer, and load these back into Tintallë later.

## Saving Colors to a File

Saving to a file saves the currently configured settings for all [color banks](banks.md).

To save to a file, from the menu bar click **File :material-arrow-right-thin: Save Colors...**. Tintallë will prompt you for a location and filename to save.

!!! note
    This will save whatever is currently configured in Tintallë, not what is saved on the Anima!

## Loading Colors from a File

To load colors from a file, from the menu bar click **File :material-arrow-right-thin: Load Colors...**. Tintallë will prompt you to select the file you want to load. Tintallë will read the file and load the settings from it for all [color banks](banks.md). This only loads them into Tintallë, however; they will not be written to your Anima until you explicitly [save](saving.md) them.

!!! warning
    Loading from a file will overwrite any [unsaved](saving.md) changes you have made to any color bank in Tintallë!
