# Selecting an Effect

Your Anima can store separate color values for each of three effects: main color, clash color, and swing color. Tintallë lets you select which effect to edit using the Effect Selectors.

    - **Main**: The color of the blade when you are not moving your saber.
    - **Clash**: The color of the blade when you hit something or your saber is hit.
    - **Swing**: The color of the blade when you move your saber freely.
